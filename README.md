## OverviewðŸš€
Two threads calculating Taylor polynomials and a corresponding MANIM animation for the sake of better view
## Featuresâš¡

- **Taylor Polynomials Calculation**: Computed Taylor series for cos(x), $e^x$ , and sin(x).
- **Visualization**: Rendered graphs of these polynomials with the `manim` library.
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilized threading to speed up the rendering process.
- **Video Output**: The final output is a video showcasing the Taylor polynomials.
